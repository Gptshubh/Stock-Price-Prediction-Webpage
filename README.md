# Stock-Price-Prediction-Webpage
Built an LSTM network model that uses real time data which gets fetched from yahoo finance website. It works by getting trained on
closing prices for the stock to predict prices.

Used streamlit library to make an UI which takes input of the company you want to predict stock prices.
